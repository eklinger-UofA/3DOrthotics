class Coverage(models.Model):

    """Model of a clients coverage.

    This is meant to cover most of the cases of how coverage would work.
    Following are some examples:

    1) Some plans have a pool for coverage, say $10,000 for everything per
    year per person under the insurance plan. This includes primaries
    and dependents.

    EX. $10,000 can be used for eveything, dental, orthotics, hospital etc.
    Once you go over that $10,000 nothing else is covered

    Modeling:
    Have the total coverage amount, amount remaining of that total, amount
    we have claimed against it. Coverage % would likely be 100% until that
    limit is reached and then the coverage % won't be considered. Billing
    can still be of certain types and the roll-over timeframe can be set
    as normal

    2) More common are plans as follows. The client has a max for each expense,
    normally covering themselves and dependents.

    EX. Dental will have $500 per year, orthotics will have $300 max every three years.

    Modeling:
    Have the total coverage amount, amount remaining and amount claimed. The
    calc for amount remaining should be as easy as taking the total and minus
    the amount claimed. However this may change if they go elsewhere for something
    that is covered elsewhere and then comes back to us. The amount remaining then
    should be dynamic and calculated separately from our numbers. (Have to ask Danny)
    Coverage % may be different for each plan, say some will be 50%, others 100% and
    will obviously drop to 0% once the coverage is used during the roll-over timeframe.

    Fields:
    max coverage
    total claimed
    total remaining
    coverage %
    billing type (direct, indirect)
    roll over timeframe (selected as years or date, saved as a date)
    coverage exceeded
