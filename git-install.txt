Install Git:

To install Git on a unix-based operating system, the simplest way is to complle
from source. Dmg files are available for installation on mac os X, but these 
may not work on older versions. To begin, download the appropriate zipped tar
archive from https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/. Unzip and unarchive
the file, move into the created directory.

Many installation options exist, the simplest is:

$ make prefix=/usr all doc info
# make prefix=/usr install install-doc install-html install-info 

Note that any commands preceeded by a hash mark will need to be run either as
root, or with sudo privileges.

Another option is to setup a more personalized autoconf:

$ make configure
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make all doc
# make install install-doc install-html

Alternatively, though not necessarily recommended, you may run git without
installing it by setting path variables to the executables:

$ GIT_EXEC_PATH=`pwd`
$ PATH=`pwd`:$PATH
$ GITPERLLIB=`pwd`/perl/blib/lib
$ export GIT_EXEC_PATH PATH GITPERLLIB
