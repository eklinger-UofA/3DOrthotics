DB scheme for app:

Hi Danny, below is the rough idea i have for the DB scheme from our talk on the weekend, I have done some research so far this week on alternative providers for web hosting, looking as prices and guarenteed uptime. Stuff like that. I have found some interesting alternatives and once i have a few i can present them to you and we pick one. I think i will be able to have something deployed that you can visit and start looking at mid August or so.
